# MERN Workout Tracker

This project is a simple workout tracker application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). The app allows users to create, view, update, and delete workouts. This project was built for learning purposes to understand the workflow of developing full-stack applications using the MERN stack.

## Features

- **Create Workouts:** Add new workouts with details such as title, load (in kg), and repetitions.
- **View Workouts:** See a list of all workouts, sorted by creation date.
- **Update Workouts:** Modify workout details.
- **Delete Workouts:** Remove workouts from the list.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB:** NoSQL database for storing workout data.
- **Express.js:** Backend framework to handle API requests.
- **React.js:** Frontend library to build the user interface.
- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime for building the backend.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- MongoDB (local or cloud instance)

## Folder Structure

- **backend/:** Contains the Node.js/Express backend with models, controllers, and routes.
- **frontend/:** Contains the React application for the user interface.

## Learning Outcomes

This project was built to:

- **Understand how to integrate the MERN stack components:** Learn how to connect MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js to create a full-stack application.
- **Practice creating RESTful APIs with Express:** Develop and handle API endpoints for CRUD operations.
- **Work with MongoDB for database management:** Use MongoDB for data storage and retrieval.
- **Implement frontend-backend communication using fetch:** Make HTTP requests from the React frontend to the Express backend.
- **Use React's context API and hooks to manage state:** Utilize React Context and Hooks for state management and component communication.

## Future Improvements

- **User Authentication:** Implement user registration and login features to manage user-specific data.
- **Enhanced Validation:** Add more detailed validation for workout fields to ensure data integrity.
- **Pagination:** Introduce pagination for workout lists to improve performance and usability with large datasets.
- **Styling Enhancements:** Improve the UI/UX with advanced styling and responsive design.
- **Error Handling:** Implement more comprehensive error handling and user feedback mechanisms.
